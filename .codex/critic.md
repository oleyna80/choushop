# Codex Critic Subagent Contract

Purpose: give Codex the same decision-check pattern that Claude Code has:
the Codex-Orchestrator is not the sole unchecked decision maker on
non-trivial Work Blocks.

The critic is read-only. It challenges the Orchestrator's Stage 0 decisions
before implementation starts, returns findings to the Orchestrator, and gives
the Owner an audit trail for later review. The Orchestrator records the result
in `memory-bank/review-log.md`.

## Position in the Flow

```text
Stage 0: Routing Preflight        Codex-Orchestrator
Stage 0.5: Codex Critic Review    read-only critic subagent
Stage 1: Implementation           scoped coder / main thread
Stage 2: Verification             verifier / checks
Stage 3: Sync & Report            Codex-Orchestrator
```

Owner approval of a Work Block authorizes the Codex-Orchestrator to run the
critic automatically when the triggers below match. The Owner does not need to
ask for the critic separately.

## Mandatory Triggers

Run Stage 0.5 Codex Critic Review when Stage 0 is complete and any condition is
true:

- Work Block touches 3+ files
- side-effect class is Production code write or higher
- new subagent topology is used
- 2+ skills are skipped in one Work Block
- Work Block involves security, auth, payments, DB, deploy, or external providers
- Codex acts as mega-orchestrator for a Claude Code handoff
- `Subagent-Required` classification is skipped with reason `trivial`

## Valid Skip Conditions

Skipping the critic is allowed only for:

- trivial single-file typo/comment/docs correction with no logic change
- pure read-only research with no file writes
- Owner explicitly approves skipping the critic for the current Work Block

Every skip must be recorded in:

- `.codex/write-gate.md`
- `memory-bank/orchestrator-log.md`

## Runtime Modes

| Mode | When to use | Required label |
|---|---|---|
| Native Codex subagent | Preferred for non-trivial Work Blocks when subagents are available | `Codex Critic: READY` |
| Same-session fallback | Native subagent/fork is unavailable, but critique is still required | `Codex Critic: FALLBACK` |
| External critic | High-risk WB benefits from Claude Code, MCP, or another reviewer | `Codex Critic: READY` plus report path |
| Skipped | Skip condition is valid and recorded | `Codex Critic: SKIPPED` |

The fallback mode must be named honestly. Do not describe a same-session review
as an independent subagent.

## Inputs

The critic receives:

- Work Block objective and expected final result
- approved scope and out-of-scope list
- Stage 0 Routing Preflight
- planned write-set
- skill routing decisions and skip reasons
- subagent topology
- side-effect class, DB action mode, and hard stops
- planned verification tier and checks

## Critique Dimensions

| Dimension | What to check |
|---|---|
| Scope | Write-set matches objective; no scope creep; missing files noted |
| Skill routing | Required skills were used or skipped with strong reasons |
| Subagent topology | Delegation is useful, bounded, and not excessive |
| Risk | Hard stops, side effects, secrets, DB, deploy, provider risks are named |
| Verification | Checks match blast radius and acceptance criteria |
| Decision quality | Rationale is concrete enough to audit later |

## Output Contract

The critic returns:

```markdown
## Codex Critic Report - [Work Block ID]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Reviewed:** Stage 0 Routing Preflight + Work Block definition
**Mode:** native-subagent | fallback-same-session | external
**Verdict:** APPROVE | SUPPLEMENT | RECONSIDER

### Findings
| Severity | Dimension | Finding | Evidence | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|

### Required Orchestrator Response
- [How each Must Address item was handled]

### Inspection Gaps
- [What could not be checked and why]
```

The Orchestrator stores full reports in `docs/reports/critic-<work-block-id>.md`
when the Work Block is non-trivial enough to keep an artifact. Short fallback
reviews may be logged only in `memory-bank/review-log.md` if the Work Block is
small.

## Verdict Semantics

| Verdict | Meaning | Orchestrator action |
|---|---|---|
| APPROVE | No material issue found | Proceed to Stage 1 |
| SUPPLEMENT | Minor gap found | Address or explicitly accept before Stage 1 |
| RECONSIDER | Material gap found | Re-run Stage 0 before Stage 1 |

The critic is advisory, not a write gate owner. The Orchestrator decides, but
must record the response in `memory-bank/orchestrator-log.md`.

## Authority Limits

- Read-only only.
- No file writes, commits, pushes, deploys, DB actions, or secret reads.
- No expansion of the approved Work Block scope.
- No launching Claude Code from inside a Codex critic subagent.
- No `READY` or `BLOCKED` gate verdicts; only critic verdicts above.
